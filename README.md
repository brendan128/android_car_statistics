# android_car_statistics
The code used to build my android app which could record and display OBDII car data using a bluetooth accessory. 

The application will connect to a car’s OBD system via a Bluetooth adapter which is plugged into the car. 

The application provides real time monitoring functionality, as  well as recording and sharing of the vehicle’s statistics.

The code is written to work on Android 4.4 (API level 19), which was KitKat.
